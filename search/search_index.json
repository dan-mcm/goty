Kathy Rain I\u2019m still currently playing through this one but think it\u2019s fair to put it on this list. It\u2019s got that charming nostalgia factor of the adventure games of old. There\u2019s some light puzzles in it which haven\u2019t proved anything too difficult but the odd time I\u2019ve resulted to a google out of lack of patience rather than anything to blame the game on. The plot is based around the protag as a journalism student investigating the death of her recently deceased grandfather - during which weird things crop up. It gave me some vibes of the blackwell series but minus the ghosts. I think it\u2019s one worth checking out if your looking for a Point & Click adventure you haven\u2019t tried out yet. 9. They Are Billions This fucking game. I hope to play more of it this month, but it\u2019s by far the hardest RTS game I\u2019ve come up against. The difficulty or rather the learning curve is super harsh. I\u2019ve completed about 3 missions of the campaign and barely at that. The game is super punishing in that the tech tree is locked behind a currency you obtain from completing missions - this means in between missions you can decide to unlock the next tier of soldier or structure or tech knowledgy. So far this sounds fair\u2026 BUT here is the thing I really dislike about this. The game records the number of times you lose a mission, reducing the total possible rewarded currency you can get from a mission. So it\u2019s possible to lose a mission X times and end up completing it only to come away with\u2026 I\u2019m guessing\u2026 close to nothing. This HEAVILY disincentivizes you to lose which is an interesting concept for a rogue-like-esque RTS style of play but when you\u2019re coming to it for the first time it\u2019s a lot to take into consideration and try to figure out. It\u2019s fun but man, it\u2019s fucking difficult. 8. The Vagrant This game caught me off guard. I expected it to be just another boring side scrolling game but it has it\u2019s own unique charm. For whatever reason it\u2019s reminiscent of Dust: An Elysian Tale. There is a skill tree you can progress through and some mechanics around your in-game combat system/special abilities that make the combat in my opinion slightly above average for this style of game. There\u2019s also some rune systems that enable you to upgrade your weapons along the way with passive bonuses which is interesting but not really fleshed out in a meaningful way that I\u2019ve seen yet. The plot isn\u2019t anything special but there is still something very satisfying to the gameplay that makes up for that fact. It\u2019s a good mindless go in hack and slash the shit out of some enemies then call it a night. 7. Othercide In three words: Lovecraftian Rogue-like X-Com. Turn based strategy game set in a harrowing black/white and red art style. The game itself is very run based and set on a mission selection style format, the unique aspect of this being you can resurrect previously fallen characters which adds a level of strategy to your gameplay. Some runs you may opt to just power up a character so you can level them up and revive them in future runs. Other runs you will be focused on exploiting the weaknesses of certain bosses/opponents that are currently causing you problems. There\u2019s a bunch of perma unlocks you get along the way that make subsequent runs easier. The fighting mechanics are interesting in that it plays on this initiative timeline that you can exploit to your advantage, doing extra abilities in a turn may get you out of a bind but paralyze you for a full turn. Generally speaking your party is limited to a maximum of three per mission, so you need to select carefully based on your characters strengths/weaknesses. I\u2019m surprised I haven\u2019t seen more of this game in the press, I think it\u2019s a very solid turn based strategy game - that I\u2019ve yet to progress too far in it. 6. The Suicide of Rachel Foster This game falls very much under the walking simulator style of game - very reminiscent in parts to the likes of Firewatch. The game has a very interesting story to tell and sets the atmosphere excellently, it had me jumping out of my chair during certain parts - the audio is absolutely phenomenal with headphones and super immersive. It deals with the subject material very tastefully while at the same time portraying quite an intense story. I\u2019m also a sucker for narrative games that allow for multiple endings. Definitely recommend if you\u2019re looking for a new Gone Home/Firewatch type game. 5. Among Us I\u2019ve played a bunch of this in chat rooms with some people I know as well as solo in public lobbies, there is definitely something unique about this for a co-op multiplayer experience. The key premise being there are two imposters amongst your team that you need to vote out before they kill you and your fellow crewmates. Rounds are mostly a combination of minigames that when all crewmates complete you win, however more often than not imposters will kill your fellow crewmates before you can get all tasks completed. The real magic to this game comes to voting rounds, players can either manually call an emergency meeting at certain intervals, or alternatively you can call a meeting by reporting a dead bound you have found. During these voting rounds everyone needs to decide who they want to vote to eject from the ship - and therein the chaos lies. It\u2019s a perfect demonstration of how the Jury system doesn\u2019t work - and how little evidence can be required to convince people to vote off innocent crewmates during a game. This game shines brightest when played on stream in front of an audience watching the chaos unfold. I\u2019ve had lots of hilarious moments playing this and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what the dev\u2019s plan to do next with it. Also hilarious to note AOC was playing this during the year - bizzare. 4. Control (Ultimate Edition) I only got around to playing this game this December alongside it\u2019s DLCs \u201cThe Foundation\u201d and \u201cAWE\u201d. As an entire package it blew me away by the end - I was expecting a short 10 hour experience and got way more than I bargained for. I think this was a VERY impressive third person shooter (controller is a must) with interesting narrative hooks, it\u2019s one of a few games that I took time to read through the collectibles to get a better idea of what was happening in the game\u2019s narrative. I felt the early hours were lacking in terms of gameplay but come the mid-late game having unlocked multiple weapons/abilities it opened up a lot of variety and enabled a nice feel of progression towards the story and general character progression. The visual style to the game is very striking and the way it narrates the plot through in-game videos and conversations with characters is definitely noteworthy for other game devs. 3. Hades I\u2019ve loved both Bastion & Transistor so it was no surprise that I also loved Hades. I was a little hesitant going in due to the rogue-like nature of the games mechanics but they integrated the story aspects seamlessly into the games format which added a compelling driving force for repeating runs and constantly pushing forward through the pain; it made for something special. I have still yet to beat Hades but I\u2019ve come close on many occasions. I still plug in and bash away at it in short 30minute or so bursts - a gorgeous looking game with some beautiful artistry that elegantly represents the Greek Gods. Definitely hope they do more with the universe/setting. 2. Genshin Impact There\u2019s no other way to look at this game than being a better, bigger and cheaper/free version of a well built Zelda game. It\u2019s basically breadth of the wild on steroids with the added option of micro transactions. I tend to use this as more of a podcast/netflix game paying little attention to the story but enjoying grinding out mobs or doing many of the open world puzzles available to you. Thoroughly enjoyable, playing it with originally Japanese voices with subtitles. It\u2019s difficult to not recommend trying it for an hour or two to see if you enjoy it. The game doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously and is clearly built for that returning gaming experience. There are some moral implications around the gambling/lootbox free to play hooks they have in it but honestly I haven\u2019t paid a cent yet and I\u2019m still nowhere near to touching all the content. It\u2019s hard to not give this game praise. 1. Command & Conquer Remastered Collection A truly fantastic remaster of the original Tiberian Dawn & Red Alert games at a dirt cheap price of \u20ac25. They did an outstanding job of the audio and control remastering and added fantastic graphical overhauls while also keeping a graphics toggle option available for the full nostalgic feel. The online multiplayer aspects of the game were great to get involved with - its a very small community which made it something special. I was able to partake in a few tournaments this year and also host a couple myself which was pretty special! (also got to make several connections out in the eSports world which is kinda rad). The dev support for it was cut off a couple months ago and sadly the online state of the game is now dead but all-in-all for the buy in price it was a hell of a bargain and thus earns #1 on my list this year!

First, games are bad now, because money people got in too deep and it influences game design in boring ways. Second, the whole \u201cgames press\u201d scene is a complete joke, oscillating between treating their digital-toys as some sort of profound, discourse-worthy artform and shilling for crap games like the Last of Us 2. Now, onto the list\u2026 (there were pictures but they didn\u2019t paste across and I\u2019m lazy to troubleshoot). 10. The Last of Us Part 2 OK look I know what I said but it IS actually a good game that got better as it went along. Abby was a better protagonist than Ellie and watching internet crybabies lose their shit made it a shoo-in. It\u2019s not half as good as the critics said but decent shooting mechanics and the best performance-capture tech in the industry, not to mention a relatively polished and bug-free experience which is apparently no-longer the standard. 9. Fuser I definitely spent way too much money on this game (full price retail) and I will probably only put another few hours in but I still love it because it\u2019s fun, accessible, and not like anything else I\u2019ve ever played. It\u2019s great tech under the hood and it allows you to be creative without having to have the talent or time necessary to make all the tweaks yourself. It would feature higher if it wasn\u2019t for the business-stuff, those tracks are too expensive. Oh also the \u201cstory mode\u201d is so cringe. 8. Ori and the Will of the Wisps It\u2019s nothing particularly special but I found it better than the original Ori. Just a beautiful metroidvania with tight controls and the best audiovisuals in it\u2019s space. 7. Star Wars: Squadrons This was a real fun surprise. 40 bucks at retail, does exactly what it says o nthe tin \u2013 gives you the Star Wars fighter-pilot experience on either side of the divide. Great dogfighting mechanics and the multiplayer was legit fun, I enjoyed every game I was in, even those that I took a beating in. 6. Doom Eternal This makes the list despite of itself. Could have been around number one if they trimmed a lot of the fat; put that entire shite story in the bin, get rid of every single jumping bit (replace it with a nice looking corridor), take at least 2 \u201ccurrencies\u201d out, lose one weapon. Make the maps half the size and shave it down to a 10 hour experience and bam \u2013 you have one of my favourite games ever. Instead it\u2019s this horrible bloated mess with the best FPS combat arena encounters probably ever. Darting around, inflicting multitudes of violence, topping up armour, health and ammo as you go\u2026. when it clicks, the murder-ballet is just sensational. 5. Hades Another game overhyped by the games-press, but it is very good. They made great use of the beta program, everything feels really well-balanced and tested. I only completed the one run and had enough after that \u2013 has that typical supergiant flair\u2026 art and sound design is top notch and the combat mechanics are what you\u2019d expect too. The way they weave the narrative into a roguelike is great and Dusa basically guaranteed its place on the list alone. 4. Spelunky 2 It\u2019s Spelunky, one of the best games ever made, but better. I\u2019m not very good at it but I still boot it up all the time. 3. Halo Masterchief Collection PC Going through this at various points of the year was fantastic, seeing the evolution of Bungie (and how the quality immediately nosedives with Halo 4) and the work they put into the remaster of Halo 2 in particular\u2026! Brilliant stuff. Still plays great (on a controller at least) and was a fun nostalgia trip. Those mechanics are really timeless (although some of the level design certainly isn\u2019t, Halo 1, I\u2019m looking at you pal). Good to laugh at the ridiculous story too. 2. Ghosts of Tsushima Probably my favourite ever game graphically speaking. It looks beautiful. If this game was set anywhere else I wonder if it would make this list at all, but who cares, I loved the setting, the characters and the quests. Like all open world games it\u2019s a bit icon-busy but not half as bad as an Assassins Creed or anything. It\u2019s basically another Horizon Zero Dawn for me. Think I took around 1,000 screenshots over the course of my playthrough! 1. FFVII Remake This game has problems (mostly that it\u2019s UGLY in spots) but they\u2019re so meaningless in the face of its achievements I don\u2019t really care. They stayed ridiculously true to the original (seriously, for every time I thought \u201cI wonder if they included this obscure thing\u2026.\u201d The answer was always yes.), add in plenty of original content (some of it great, some of it not so much) and expand the Midgar section into a fantastic standalone game. It has the best music, the characters all look and sound like out of my imagination, and the twist on the combat mechanics is genius (basically replacing ATB with \u201creal time with pause\u201d). You fight a giant house, what else can I say? Can\u2019t wait for part 2!","title":"Dave"},{"location":"2020/dave/#video-games-are-bad-now-aka-daves-goty-2020","text":"There are two things which solidified in my mind this year.

They stayed ridiculously true to the original (seriously, for every time I thought \u201cI wonder if they included this obscure thing\u2026.\u201d The answer was always yes.), add in plenty of original content (some of it great, some of it not so much) and expand the Midgar section into a fantastic standalone game. It has the best music, the characters all look and sound like out of my imagination, and the twist on the combat mechanics is genius (basically replacing ATB with \u201creal time with pause\u201d).

Wasteland 3 Beep Beep Motherfucker Ah, Wasteland, you could have been so much more. The opening hours of this game excited me for the prospect of quality gunplay and an apparently deep itemisation and skill system. Sadly, it all boiled down to finding the least bad available options at any given point, cheesing combat, and basically getting every skill in the group. Made the list because of the fairly decent - or at least fairly enjoyable - writing. And running people over with your tank never gets old. Didn\u2019t even finish this in the end, the bugs and load times were just too bad by the final act and I was drawn to other, more stable titsl. 8. & 9. Ion Fury/Dusk Occupado The \u201cwhat if quake but using modern tech\u201d craze continues. I\u2019ve grouped these two because they\u2019re basically the same game. Frantic, million-mile-per-hour shooters with beefy campaigns and a real challenge on the right difficulties. I know some parts of the industry are tired of this shooter resurgence but honestly give me a campaign over a fucking roguelike any day. Ideal games to just pop into here and there and blast out a few levels. 7. Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate Evie will fuck you up An old game that I got a ton of time out of this year! The sense of place is great and the arcadey nature of the combat means its just plain old fun. Ultimately my inability to pass a chest icon without hunting it down doomed this game to incompletion but it was just fucking rad. Also the train base was rad as hell. Like most modern open world games its very CPU intensive and my system struggled a bit with it, or I would have kept going I suspect. 6. Doom Eternal This Fuckin Guy No game even came close to getting my adrenaline pumping like Doom Eternal in 2020. On ultraviolence the challenge is truly mammoth and there is a headspace you enter where your hands just fucking take over as you swing jump dodge flamethrower in a way that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever experienced. It is honestly a weird state of combat zen that is hard to explain. Would be higher but for the lame platforming and bad end boss who I didn\u2019t bother beating. Even the addition of the much-maligned Marauder (decried by critics as ruining the game!) added a twist to the combat I really enjoyed. Remember those clips in the 90s of nerds doing 2 rubiks cubes at the same time really fast while remaining completely calm and expressionless? Doom Eternal is like that but instead of cubes its bloody, flaming chainsaws. 5. The Suicide of Rachel Foster What if Firewatch, but also the Shining? A really, REALLY good Walking Simulator. Not really much else to say about it. You already know if this kind of game appeals to you. Almost as good as its obvious inspiration, The Remains of Edith Finch. Almost. 4. Blasphemous Maybe he\u2019s on my side? (Spoilers: He Wasn\u2019t) Side-scrolling souls like. Plays great, controls well, but really it\u2019s elevated by its rather spectacular art style and some of the bananas boss designs really steal the show. 3. Children of Morta Between missions, story events unfold in the forest home where our family is based. This ones a bit of a cheat as I started in December last. A really amazing twin-stick pixelart fantasy game. It\u2019s all about family, and also killing monsters. You play as different members of a family who all have their own very unique playstyles. My only complaint is I thought the final boss was a tad too easy. 2. Genshin Impact I still don\u2019t know how they made a version of this that runs on fucking mobiles. Honestly, the only reason this didn\u2019t end up at #1 is the scummy gatcha mechanics (which are entirely avoidable). The world is massive and beautiful, the writings really fun (Paimon rules), the combat\u2019s alright, and the constant flow of content is hard to ignore. I must be well over a hundred hours now and I\u2019m still putting in an hour or two most days. It is scary how much I\u2019ve been enjoying this game. 1. Hades Did I mention it\u2019s super horny? Supergiant, creators of Bastion and other similar games, created the perfect roguelike. Dripping in charm, the art is amazing, it feels incredible to play, the writing is next level, and there\u2019s even some rad mechanical innovations. This game is so good that I genuinely do not believe it is possible to make a better roguelike.
