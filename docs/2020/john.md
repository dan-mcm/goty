# John's Top 5 Games 2020

## 5. All of the Resident Evils!

Played through every game available on the PC, RE3 remake officially my favourite entry in the franchise which I accept is not a popular choice.

## 4. Beautiful Desolation.
Two brothers make their way through a foreign land with their robot dog.  It's an RPG with no stats or combat!

## 3. Wasteland 3.
In what's starting to become a trend of sorts, starts strong but has nothing new to offer after the first couple of hours.  See The Outer Worlds and RE7.   

## 2. Cyberpunk 2077.
In 2007 CDPR released a broken mess of an RPG but through strong post-launch support managed to build a reputation as a consumer friendly darling.  13 years later, they done fucked it up.

## 1. The Last Of Us 2.
Affecting despite a story that threads a well worn road.  Stuck with me in a way I wasn't expecting.
