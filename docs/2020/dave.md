# VIDEO GAMES ARE BAD NOW – AKA Dave’s GOTY 2020

There are two things which solidified in my mind this year. First, games are bad now, because money people got in too deep and it influences game design in boring ways. Second, the whole “games press” scene is a complete joke, oscillating between treating their digital-toys as some sort of profound, discourse-worthy artform and shilling for crap games like the Last of Us 2. Now, onto the list… (there were pictures but they didn't paste across and I'm lazy to troubleshoot).

## 10. The Last of Us Part 2

OK look I know what I said but it IS actually a good game that got better as it went along. Abby was a better protagonist than Ellie and watching internet crybabies lose their shit made it a shoo-in. It’s not half as good as the critics said but decent shooting mechanics and the best performance-capture tech in the industry, not to mention a relatively polished and bug-free experience which is apparently no-longer the standard.

## 9. Fuser

I definitely spent way too much money on this game (full price retail) and I will probably only put another few hours in but I still love it because it’s fun, accessible, and not like anything else I’ve ever played. It’s great tech under the hood and it allows you to be creative without having to have the talent or time necessary to make all the tweaks yourself. It would feature higher if it wasn’t for the business-stuff, those tracks are too expensive. Oh also the “story mode” is so cringe.

## 8. Ori and the Will of the Wisps

It’s nothing particularly special but I found it better than the original Ori. Just a beautiful metroidvania with tight controls and the best audiovisuals in it’s space.

<hr/>

## 7. Star Wars: Squadrons

This was a real fun surprise. 40 bucks at retail, does exactly what it says o nthe tin – gives you the Star Wars fighter-pilot experience on either side of the divide. Great dogfighting mechanics and the multiplayer was legit fun, I enjoyed every game I was in, even those that I took a beating in.

<hr/>

## 6. Doom Eternal

This makes the list despite of itself. Could have been around number one if they trimmed a lot of the fat; put that entire shite story in the bin, get rid of every single jumping bit (replace it with a nice looking corridor), take at least 2 “currencies” out, lose one weapon. Make the maps half the size and shave it down to a 10 hour experience and bam – you have one of my favourite games ever. Instead it’s this horrible bloated mess with the best FPS combat arena encounters probably ever. Darting around, inflicting multitudes of violence, topping up armour, health and ammo as you go…. when it clicks, the murder-ballet is just sensational.

## 5. Hades

Another game overhyped by the games-press, but it is very good. They made great use of the beta program, everything feels really well-balanced and tested. I only completed the one run and had enough after that – has that typical supergiant flair… art and sound design is top notch and the combat mechanics are what you’d expect too. The way they weave the narrative into a roguelike is great and Dusa basically guaranteed its place on the list alone.

<hr/>

## 4. Spelunky 2

It’s Spelunky, one of the best games ever made, but better. I’m not very good at it but I still boot it up all the time.

<hr/>

## 3. Halo Masterchief Collection PC

Going through this at various points of the year was fantastic, seeing the evolution of Bungie (and how the quality immediately nosedives with Halo 4) and the work they put into the remaster of Halo 2 in particular…! Brilliant stuff. Still plays great (on a controller at least) and was a fun nostalgia trip. Those mechanics are really timeless (although some of the level design certainly isn’t, Halo 1, I’m looking at you pal). Good to laugh at the ridiculous story too.

<hr/>

## 2. Ghosts of Tsushima

Probably my favourite ever game graphically speaking. It looks beautiful. If this game was set anywhere else I wonder if it would make this list at all, but who cares, I loved the setting, the characters and the quests. Like all open world games it’s a bit icon-busy but not half as bad as an Assassins Creed or anything. It’s basically another Horizon Zero Dawn for me. Think I took around 1,000 screenshots over the course of my playthrough!

<hr/>

## 1. FFVII Remake

This game has problems (mostly that it’s UGLY in spots) but they’re so meaningless in the face of its achievements I don’t really care. They stayed ridiculously true to the original (seriously, for every time I thought “I wonder if they included this obscure thing….” The answer was always yes.), add in plenty of original content (some of it great, some of it not so much) and expand the Midgar section into a fantastic standalone game. It has the best music, the characters all look and sound like out of my imagination, and the twist on the combat mechanics is genius (basically replacing ATB with “real time with pause”). You fight a giant house, what else can I say? Can’t wait for part 2!
