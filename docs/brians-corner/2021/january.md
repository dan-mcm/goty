RPG Rogue game, high difficulty at times however not too ludacris, story as always in this a bit vague but some nice little hidden bits and unknown sidequests that you suddenly stumble upon. 20+ hours.

## Morbid and The 7 Acolytes - completed

<b>MetaCritic Score</b>: 7/10  
<b>BrianCritic Score</b>: 7.5/10

<b>You would like this if you liked</b>:  
quite a unique game for me, a bit like retro graphics meet Diablo 3

<b>Brief Review</b>:  
Billed as a “Horror Punk action” the game is a fun top down view linear enough experience. They have a built in system of a “sanitiy guage” which basically means that when you take x amount of dame your sanity goes down increase the numbers and difficulty of opponents however, never once was an issue as sanity stim packs are in abundance, may of made the game experience more or less enjoyable if they had succeeded in their attempt to differentiate the game via this component. That aside, an enjoyable and difficult experience again with the emphasis on the difficulty becoming less and less with every failed attempt as opposed to just continually dyeing over and over and needing luck to progress. 20+ hours

<b>Would pay?</b> €20  
<b>Cost?</b> €10

## Feudal Alloy - completed

<b>You would like this if you liked</b>:  
Foregone, Hyperlight Drifter

<b>Brief Review:</b>  
Graphically speaking a lovely 2d platformer with very limited and light RPG elements. Never found the difficulty taxing however the light hearted SFX and again enjoyable graphics just made it a nice game to play start to finish without any major disturbances.

<b>Would pay?</b> €15  
<b>Cost?</b> €15

## Foregone - completed

<b>You would like this if you liked</b>:  
Bastion, not punching walls whilst playing games

<b>Brief Review</b>:  
Delighted I found this little gem with my own research, coming to pc in March this year. Really cool side scrolling platformer, an actual story with some light equipment upgrades and moderation. As you can have a bow an arrow think it automatically makes any game better than it should seem. 20 hours odd

Aload of indie nonsense, I get what they were trying to do but it’s a big fat no from me, unless I can smoke whatever the developers where smoking when they put this shite togeather.
